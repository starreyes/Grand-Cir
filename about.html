    <h1>The Davis Girlz</h1>
    <p>
    Hello there! Nice to see you. We are the Davis girls and are happy
    to have you visit our page. By now, you've seen our photos from our
    recent trip to Chicago, Illinois with a stop at West Beach!
    </p>
    <p> Oh did we have fun! Our adventure took us on a road trip
    across multiple states and we got a chance to stop and enjoy the
    beauty of each we visited.
<br>
    Shhhhhh! We left daddy at home. Hmmmm, maybe next time...who
    are we kidding, NOT!
    <br>
    Girl's just wanna have fun!
