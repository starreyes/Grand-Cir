       <h2>Our Girls Trip - Chicago Summer 2017</h2>
       <p>Summer 2017 was <em>amazing</em>!
       My daugthers and I had a blast. We went on a girls
       trip to Chicago, Illinois to work on a movie
       set and boi did we have a great time!</p>

       <hr />

       <p>Our trip included stops at the following
         points of interest during our stay:
         <ol>
           <li>Lake Shore Drive</li>
           <li><a href="http://www.sheddaquarium.org/" target="_blank">Shedd Aquarium</a> (opens in new window)</li>
           <li>Giordono's Pizzeria</li>
           <li>Garrett's Popcorn</li>
           <li>West Beach (Indiana)</li>
         </ol>
        This was especially nice since it was also my daughter's
        birthday weekend as well.

         <p>As Ludacris once said, "My work is like my vacation so in a
           way every day is like Saturday."</p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>This was true for us since working on the movie set brought
          about amazing experiences as did all of the adventures we took
          on our drive there and our return. Every day truly felt like <em>Saturday</em>.
